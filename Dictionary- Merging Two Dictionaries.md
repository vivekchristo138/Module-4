## Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that merges **two dictionaries** and combines their key-value pairs.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` with some key-value pairs.
2. Define a function `merge()` that merges the two dictionaries using the `**` unpacking operator.
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from `dict2` will overwrite that from `dict1`.
3. Call the `merge()` function and print the merged dictionary.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
dict1 = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "New York"
}

dict2 = {
    "age": 30,
    "country": "USA"
}

def merge(d1, d2):
    merged_dict = {**d1, **d2}  
    return merged_dict


result = merge(dict1, dict2)
print(result)
```

## Result
Thus the program is executed is successfully.
